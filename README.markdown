ISO 8601 DateFormat
==============================

This library provides a subclass of [`DateFormat` class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/DateFormat.html)
to parse and format dates formats of which are specified by [ISO 8601](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm)
(or by [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) or [W3C-DTF](https://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-datetime-19980827)).

Currently, only combined date and time representations with extended format are supported.

* 2016-01-01T00:30:21Z
* 2016-01-01T09:30:21+09:00

## Targets of this library

* Java SE 6 environments
* Android platforms

On these runtime environments, the `SimpleDateFormat` class doesn't support ISO 8601 time zone fully.
(On Android platforms, the `Z` pattern character is able to read a time zone style of which is `Â±HH:MM`. But it cannot read `Z`.)

On Java SE 7 environments (or later), you can use `X` pattern character with `SimpleDateFormat` class.
(e.g. `new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssX", Locale.ROOT)`.)

On Java SE 8 environments (or later), you should probably use the
[Date and Time API](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-date-time-2125367.html).
If you want to use Date and Time API on Android platforms, see [ThreeTen Android Backport](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP).

## Usage

This library is published to JCenter.

```java
import info.vividcode.time.iso8601.Iso8601ExtendedOffsetDateTimeFormat;

DateFormat f = new Iso8601ExtendedOffsetDateTimeFormat();
Date d1 = f.parse("1970-01-01T00:00:00Z");
Date d2 = f.parse("1970-01-01T09:00:00+09:00");
```
